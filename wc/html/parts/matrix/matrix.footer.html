    <p>Note: All estimates on this page are in U.S. dollar terms. Given the complex risk-reward trade-offs involved, we advise clients to rely on judgment as well as quantitative optimization approaches in setting strategic allocations to all of these asset classes and strategies. Please note that all information shown is based on qualitative analysis. Exclusive reliance on this information is not advised. This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise of future performance. Note that these asset class and strategy assumptions are passive only–they do not consider the impact of active management. References to future returns are not promises or even estimates of actual returns a client portfolio may achieve. Assumptions, opinions and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only.

    <p>Source: J.P. Morgan Asset Management; data as of September 30, 2017, except hedge funds, private equity, real estate and infrastructure, as of June 30, 2017. Alternative asset classes (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, direct lending and infrastructure) are unlike other asset categories shown above in that there is no underlying investible index. The return estimates for these alternative asset classes and strategies are estimates of the industry average, net of manager fees. The dispersion of return among managers of these asset classes and strategies is typically significantly wider than that of traditional asset classes. Return estimates for direct real estate are unlevered.  *U.S. Intermediate Treasuries reflect the 1 to 10 years sector of the market instead of the 7 to 10 years sector in prior years. Diversified hedge funds and conservative hedge funds are multi-strategy hedge funds instead of funds-of-funds in prior years. Hong Kong Equity is represented by the MSCI Hong Kong index instead of the Hang Seng index in prior years.  All returns are nominal. For reference index information, please visit our website.</p>

The outputs of the assumptions are provided for illustration/discussion purposes only and are subject to significant limitations. “Expected” or “Alpha” return estimates are subject to uncertainty and error. For example, changes in the historical data from which it is estimated will result in different implications for asset class returns. Expected returns for each asset class are conditional on an economic scenario; actual returns in the event the scenario comes to pass could be higher or lower, as they have been in the past, so an investor should not expect to achieve returns similar to the outputs shown herein. References to future returns for either asset allocation strategies or asset classes are not promises of actual returns a client portfolio may achieve. Because of the inherent limitations of all models, potential investors should not rely exclusively on the model when making a decision. The model cannot account for the impact that economic, market, and other factors may have on the implementation and ongoing management of an actual investment portfolio. Unlike actual portfolio outcomes, the model outcomes do not reflect actual trading, liquidity constraints, fees, expenses, taxes and other factors that could impact the future returns. The model assumptions are passive only—they do not consider the impact of active management. A manager’s ability to achieve similar outcomes is subject to risk factors over which the manager may have no or limited control.</p>

    <p>Source: J.P. Morgan Asset Management; data as of September 30, 2017, except hedge funds, private equity, real estate and infrastructure, as of June 30, 2017. Alternative asset classes (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, direct lending and infrastructure) are unlike other asset categories shown above in that there is no underlying investible index. The return estimates for these alternative asset classes and strategies are estimates of the industry average, net of manager fees. The dispersion of return among managers of these asset classes and strategies is typically significantly wider than that of traditional asset classes. To further clarify the asset classes provided in the matrix, we are renaming some of the alternative asset classes this year. U.S. Core Direct Real Estate is equivalent to U.S. Direct Real Estate last year. Similar changes are made across real estate assets. Global Direct Infrastructure Equity is equivalent to Global Infrastructure last year. Return estimates for direct real estate and REITs are unlevered. Correlation figures shown above are rounded to 2 significant figures, which may cause a loss of information. All returns are nominal. For reference index information, please visit our website.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>Please note that the correlation matrix is not definite when rounded to two decimals. If your intended application requires this, please request the data set from your JPMAM client advisor or through LTCMA.inquiries@jpmorgan.com. </p><p>

    <p>JPMAM Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions: Given the complex risk-reward trade-offs involved, we advise clients to rely on judgment as well as quantitative optimization approaches in setting strategic allocations. Please note that all information shown is based on qualitative analysis. Exclusive reliance on the above is not advised. This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise of future performance. Note that these asset class and strategy assumptions are passive only–they do not consider the impact of active management. References to future returns are not promises or even estimates of actual returns a client portfolio may achieve. Assumptions, opinions and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only. They should not be relied upon as recommendations to buy or sell securities. Forecasts of financial market trends that are based on current market conditions constitute our judgment and are subject to change without notice. We believe the information provided here is reliable, but do not warrant its accuracy or completeness. This material has been prepared for information purposes only and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, accounting, legal or tax advice. The outputs of the assumptions are provided for illustration/discussion purposes only and are subject to significant limitations. “Expected” or “Alpha” return estimates are subject to uncertainty and error. For example, changes in the historical data from which it is estimated will result in different implications for asset class returns. Expected returns for each asset class are conditional on an economic scenario; actual returns in the event the scenario comes to pass could be higher or lower, as they have been in the past, so an investor should not expect to achieve returns similar to the outputs shown herein. References to future returns for either asset allocation strategies or asset classes are not promises of actual returns a client portfolio may achieve. Because of the inherent limitations of all models, potential investors should not rely exclusively on the model when making a decision. The model cannot account for the impact that economic, market, and other factors may have on the implementation and ongoing management of an actual investment portfolio. Unlike actual portfolio outcomes, the model outcomes do not reflect actual trading, liquidity constraints, fees, expenses, taxes and other factors that could impact the future returns. The model assumptions are passive only—they do not consider the impact of active management. A manager’s ability to achieve similar outcomes is subject to risk factors over which the manager may have no or limited control.</p>
