                                    EA diagrams are updated in real-time to reflect the status of each process.
                                    WebSockets were employed for incremental communications between front and back end systems.

                                    creating process models within EA. These proess diagrams were then consumed by the application ready for execution.
                                    Legacy systems, Manual Inputs and Automations are integrated into a single seamless application.
                                    This project is in currently under development and refinements.

                                    These prototypes utilized my toolkit as well as shared component libraries embedded within the toolkit as well as new ones that were created and tested for various applications.
                                    Prototype components could be switched in real time for testing purposes and also various tools were provided for U/X engineers to update screens remotely and on demand.

                                <p>
                                    Management use prototypes as means of communication with various groups internal and external while other groups use them to validate designs, workflows and other usability tests.
                                    Designed and developed a “Page Builder” to help developers construct new pages rapidly and efficiently. Integrated Fidelity's Pattern Library Components into the code generator.
                                    Expansion and deployment of Page Builder will reduce development and deployment costs of new applications and products substantially and by orders of magnitude.
                                    Further deployment of components will allow company to make changes rapidly and efficiently without having to rewrite entire parts as is customary today.
